								<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Job Market Paper: Do Role Models Increase Student Hope and Effort?</h2> 

 <p style="text-align:left;"> <b>Abstract: <br>Role models can foster hope, increase effort and improve academic performance of primary school students. In an RCT in India, students were randomised at an individual level to a treatment or placebo group. Treated students watched a short film produced as a part of the experiment, while the placebo group saw a comparable television show – ‘Malgudi Days’. This intervention resulted in an immediate and sustained increase in student hope and effort, alongside improvements in their happiness. The one-off treatment increased English test scores by 0.16 sd after 6 weeks and improved exam performance in Mathematics by 0.25 sd, 2-years later.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Role models among us: experimental evidence on inspirations and gender disparities set in stones  (with J. Wen)
</h2> 

<p style="text-align:left;"> <b>Abstract:<br>
Historical monuments mediate a conversation between the past and present. Statues represent what people at some period in the past chose to commemorate and to some extent, celebrate. These range from individuals, gods and events. In this randomised controlled trial, we test the presence of such communications and their consequences from an inspirational lens. Focusing on a cohort of primary school students in India, we study the role-modelling effect of historical statues. Students in the treatment group were exposed to a short video of these otherwise locally present yet then inaccessible statutes during the Covid pandemic. The placebo group experienced an identical narrative on the same role models, with the visuals being composed of images of these role models and not their statues. There was a third pure control group. We find that treatment with a virtual tour of four statues of distinct role models in Jaipur leads to an increase in students’ academic performance. Importantly, immediately after the intervention, students watching the treatment video perform better in a memory test than the placebo and control groups. The treatment affects only boys and evidence from heterogeneity analysis suggests that the lack of female role models and their status could greatly attribute to the gender gap in academic performance in India. We postulate familiarity and susceptibility as the two fundamental constituents for relatability and as key mechanisms that fuel a motivational effect within the role modelling literature.

</h2> 

<p style="text-align:left;"> <b>Abstract:<br>
We aim to examine the impact of mental health on academic performance and the role played by reflection and literacy intervention. In that attempt, primary data of students of an undergraduate course at the University of Würzburg will be collected during one academic semester. We contribute to the existing literature by measuring both the impact of our intervention on mental health and the effect of mental health on academic performance. The results will test whether a reflection and/or a potential literacy intervention in the classroom can significantly affect mental health. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Family Size and Aspirations: Evidence from China (with J. Wen and K. Guo) </h2> 

<p style="text-align:left;"> <b>Abstract:<br>
Changes in family size can affect a family’s wealth distribution and resource allocation. An abrupt increment in the number of family members through twin-birth is detrimental to the family from a psychological and developmental standpoint. We explore this using Chinese family survey data and find that additional member lowers children’s academic aspirations and those of their parents for them. Alongside reducing parental investment and involvement, such a shock significantly reduces their long-run educational attainments. While little is known on the behavioral side of the joys of twin birth, we limit our attention to the associated undiscovered perils, in an attempt to diagnose an issue that can be resolved via policy interventions. </p>
